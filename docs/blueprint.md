# **App Name**: Mobile Storefront

## Core Features:

- Global Header: Display a header with the store logo and cart information.
- Product List View: Implement a searchable product list with filtering and result counting.
- Product Detail View: Display detailed product information, including images, prices, and color/storage options, as well as similar products
- Cart View: Implement a shopping cart interface showing added items, quantities, and total price. Enable item removal.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#222222) to match the 'color-text-dark' variable, lending a sophisticated and modern feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), mirroring the '--color-background-light-gray' CSS variable for a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Dark red (#800000), shifting slightly on the hue wheel from the primary color for subtle contrast. Darkening both value and saturation ensures sufficient contrast for elements such as the 'Eliminar' link.
- Font: 'Helvetica', Arial, sans-serif, as per the project specifications. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ a consistent spacing system using multiples of 8px or 16px, in accordance with the specification
- Use media queries extensively to adapt layouts and font sizes between desktop and mobile, as shown in the provided Figma design.
- Use the shopping cart icon (üõçÔ∏è) for the cart in the header.
